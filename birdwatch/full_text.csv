And guess what, they both agreed covid is a hoax."
"@HammSanchez @NYCSchools @UFT I believe we are in the closed school mess precisely because everyone listened to how UFT ""feels"" and ignored actual scientific evidence that schools are safe. Besides any teacher that wants a vaccine has had ample opportunity to get one. Why continue to placate the union?"
"Could we focus on the 465,000 children that go missing every year OR the 1.38 Million Americans that attempted suicide in 2020?

Unlike the Covid hoax, these numbers aren't manipulated."
@MutualAidNerd @Dave_Becker_ @newskag There have been studies after studies that show schools are safe. There will be cases inside schools. Covid isn’t going away. With masking and other mitigation strategies schools are safer than indoor dining. Benefits outweigh the risks; our kids benefit most from in person edu!
